Hi everybody, if you want to translate the mapchooser [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273019"]Galileo[/URL] to your language,
post here your translations. If you see some error or bad coloring tags positioning at
the current translations, feel free to correct and post it here. They will be available
at the future plugin versions. See also [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=86477"]here the old translation[/URL] request thread, for
old or outdated translations.

These LANG constants use '!t', '!g', and '!y' for colors. Then everything after these tags to use '!g for green', '!y for yellow' and '!t for team' color. At this plugin, all LANG constants automatically start using the yellow color. Example for:
[QUOTE]GAL_CHANGE_TIMEEXPIRED = Time limit!g has!t expired. !tThe next map!y will be '!g%s!y'.[/QUOTE]Will be viewed like this:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/47qmyN3.png[/IMG]

If someones do not want colors when using this plugin/colored LANG file, just needs to disable this cvar on the 'galileo.cfg' config file:
[PAWN]
// Enable or disable the color on the plugin text message chat (colored chat).
// 0 - Disabled
// 1 - Enabled
gal_colored_chat_enabled 1
[/PAWN]

Just do not put color tags at the LANG constants that do not already have, because they are used on the [B]server console[/B] or [B]menus[/B] like this:

The caret (^), is used as a control character, which indicates the start of an escape sequence. Escape sequences are interpreted differently than normal characters. Understanding what these characters do is important and should help make translating less difficult. You should not alter these escape sequences when translating a string. Altering them can cause undesired effects, such as forcing a client to disconnect.

The escape sequences you will commonly see in AMXX language files are:

[LIST]
[*]^n  (New-line)
[*]^t  (Horizontal tab)
[*]^^  (An actual caret)
[*]^'  (Single quote)
[*]^"  (Double quote)
[*]^%  (Percent sign)
[/LIST]

[B]Formatting codes[/B]

A second thing to be aware of is formatting codes. These are placeholders that will be replaced in the text displayed to the client or server console. You generally should be aware of whether a formatting code is numeric or text. If you want more information on what each formatting code actually represents, see the explanation of the [I]printf[/I] function in the [URL="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm#DOWNLOAD_DOCS"]Pawn Language Guide[/URL].

[LIST]
[*]%b  (numeric)
[*]%c  (text)
[*]%d  (numeric)
[*]%f  (numeric)
[*]%q  (numeric)
[*]%r  (numeric)
[*]%s  (text)
[*]%x  (numeric)
[/LIST]

[anchor]Assistant[/anchor][SIZE="5"][COLOR="Blue"][B]Translator Assistant[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE] [goanchor=Top]Go to top[/goanchor]

Translator Assistant is an aid program in for translations. This simulates one, two or three work areas (a text region), one on top of another. It was created because it is easier to translate review looking at the original on the same screen.

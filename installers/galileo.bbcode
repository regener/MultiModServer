[*]Added a check for valid map when populating the various map listings from map list files.
[*]Fixed error whem empty server map file doesn't exist.
[*]Fixed issue whereas Galileo would set the time limit to 0 in the course of it's regular
   activities but then sometimes not reset it to the original time limit afterwards.
[*]No longer tries to print menus in color if the game mod doesn't support colored menus.
[*]Fixed possible RTV exploit by introducing a delay before a single player can RTV after a
   map change. It's the lesser of either 2 minutes or the value of gal_rtv_wait.
[*]Added additional information to comments for gal_nom_mapfile, gal_vote_mapfile, and
   gal_emptyserver_mapfile in galileo.cfg.
[*]Changed default for gal_nom_prefixes from 1 to 0. In other words, the prefix functionality
   will be turned off by default.
[*]Will no longer overwrite an existing menu. This means if a player has another menu open when
   the map vote starts, they won't see the map vote until the other menu is closed. It also means
   that, after a player voted and if the server is showing the vote progress, if another menu
   overwrites Galileo's, the progress won't be shown again until the other menu has been closed.
   This only affects people that show the in-progress vote status.
[*]Now obeys a setting of "0" for gal_endofmapvote. Would previously erroneously present a vote
   regardless of the setting.
[*]New CVAR, gal_sounds_mute, to indicate if any of the sentences spoken during various events are
   muted. See galileo.cfg for more information.
[*]Added code to handle automated version info from SVN. This is of no consequence to anyone but
   me really, but I wanted to include it in the change log since it actually involves a change
   to the code.
[*]Removed benign code that was prepped for feature utilizing standard maps of each mod.
   There is no longer any plans to add any information regarding standard maps as I see no use for it.
[*]Removed the following language keys: GAL_STANDARD_NOTFOUND, GAL_STANDARD_TOOMANY, GAL_STANDARD_UNKNOWNMOD
[*]Fixed the "vote filler groups" feature that was previously working incorrectly.

People just saying it is broken/lagging and do not help providing the requested information at the main's page
[goanchor=Support]Support[/goanchor] section, will be ignored.

I am not asking to you write code, I asking to just copy and paste something from your server. Then if you
cannot neither do just such a simple thing, it will be broken for ever or until you fix by yourself, or until
someday I/or someone else notice your problem on my/their server and copy and paste what I am asking.

If you cannot help me figure out what is wrong with the plugin, it is definitely not my problem, but it is all
your problem as, you will need to use it bugged or not use at all. Which is not relevant, you should use whatever
work better for your server, if you can find such. At least on my server it is working fine and I do not see
anything wrong with it. But if you are finding and fixing bugs and not releasing/sharing  it, this is not good
from you to the others at all. Would you like I never shared the source code? That depends, if you got something
which works much better for your server, then this plugin is pretty much irrelevant to you and you would not care
whether I shared my coding or not.

Basically, I am assuming anyone which posts problems here and do not provide the requested information as trollers. Because:
[LIST=1]
[*]I do not run a server where I can test behavior related to a running voting within several people.

Maybe he's tired of supporting them. Maybe he doesn't use those anymore so it
doesn't make sense for him to support them. You can fork them if you like. You
could be the next maintainer as it is open source.

It takes time to support repos. Supporting repos is work. I know because I
support a bunch. It is often a thankless job. People always want something, but
often don't want to put in effort to contribute (even if it's just a simple
donation). People don't like to read the documentation and love to ask a
question you've documented and answered hundreds of times. People don't like to
follow instructions you give them to get your support.

With that said, there are people who do contribute. And there are those who
occasionally give thanks (sometimes verbally and sometimes with donations and
sometimes with pull requests). Those are the people that usually give repo
maintainers the motivation to keep supporting the project.

In short, sometimes it can just get tiring. And if you've moved on from your
project (you don't even use it yourself anymore), it might not make sense to
keep supporting it. Only tito can answer exactly why. But I imagine he either
doesn't use them anymore and/or is tired of supporting so many repos.

This is a feature rich map voting plugin.  It's intended to be used in place of any other
map choosing plugin such as [B]Deagles' Map Manager[/B] and AMXX's very own [B]Map Chooser[/B].

Here you can find an easter egg from Brad:
[URL="https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo"] https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo[/URL]

It is a good start to use it within this new version, but as just it do not cover all current

The original plugin [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=77391"]Galileo[/URL] is written by [B]Brad[/B]. This Galileo works as the original [B]Galileo[/B].
Moreover this [B][COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR][/B] has also special features for the [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL] plugin and
it stills can be used all alone. See the [goanchor=Change]Change Log[/goanchor] and [goanchor=Credits]Credits[/goanchor] for more details.

It is [COLOR="Red"][B]highly recommended[/B][/COLOR] you to review the well-commented "[B]galileo.cfg[/B]" to see

It is the same which is on the `[B]Galileo-X.X.X-XXX.zip[/B]` file. The difference is it is already compiled.
So you do not need to compile the `.sma`

But you still [COLOR="Red"][b]need to download[/b][/COLOR] the `[B]Galileo-X.X.X-XXX.zip[/B]` file within the resource files.
[LIST=1]
[*]The file `[B]Galileo-X.X.X-XXX.zip[/B]` contain all the files you need, including the `.sma`,
the lang file and the [COLOR="Red"][b]default settings file[/b][/COLOR].


[*]The file `[B]Minimal_Configuration_File_(Opcional_Little-Options).zip[/B]` is the
smallest setting file you need to configure. You can download it if you want to use easy
settings to configure. [COLOR="Red"][b]This file is opcional[/b][/COLOR].


[*]The file `[B]Simple_Configuration_File_(Opcional_Less-Options).zip[/B]` is a
smaller settings file. You can download it if you want to use the original settings by
`Brad's` version. [COLOR="Red"][b]This file is opcional[/b][/COLOR].
[/LIST]
[/SPOILER]
Replace '[B]Galileo-XXX[/B]' by '[B]Galileo-3.2.2[/B]' [or the current version], and download the right zip file.

[*] Download the file "[B]Galileo-XXX.zip[/B]" at [goanchor=LatestRelease]Downloads[/goanchor] section.


[*] Then take the contents of "[B]Galileo-XXX[/B]" folder from "[B]Galileo-XXX.zip[/B]", to your
[B]AMX Mod X[/B] folder usually at "[COLOR="Blue"]yourGameMod/addons/amxmodx/[/COLOR]". GameMod Examples:

[*] Put the [B]next line[/B] to your "[B]plugins.ini[/B]" file at "[COLOR="Blue"]yourGameMod/addons/amxmodx/[/COLOR][B]configs[/B]"

     If you are using both '[B]mp_timelimit[/B]/[B]mp_maxrounds[/B]/[B]mp_winlimit[/B]/[B]mp_fraglimit[/B]', it gives you the
     first to get close to finish the map. For example, suppose that there are [COLOR="Blue"]3 minutes[/COLOR] left
     and [COLOR="Blue"]10 rounds[/COLOR] remaining. It will give you by minutes, and not by rounds. And to avoid
     re-voting when those [COLOR="Blue"]10 rounds[/COLOR] end up, it will [COLOR="Blue"]temporarily[/COLOR] disables the rounds voting
     when the remaining rounds end up.


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_startvote[/B] -nochange[/COLOR] or [COLOR="Blue"]-restart[/COLOR] or [COLOR="Blue"]other args[/COLOR]', to forces a map vote
     to begin and the map will be changed immediately or at the end of the current round.
     You can see the cvar `gal_general_options` to set the default behavior to change the
     map immediately or the end of the current round.


            [LIST]
            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-nochange[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map will not be changed by
            [COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR], which is useful when you have a different plugin handling the actual
            changing of the map.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-restart[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied and the voting option "Stay Here" wins,
            the current map is restarted. This command is for the "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL]"
            plugin.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-now[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map will be changed immediately by [COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR],
            after the voting to finish. This is the same as the cvar `gal_general_options` set to 0.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-roundend[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map will only be changed by
            [COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR], after the round where the voting is going on finish. This is the same as
            the cvar `gal_general_options` set to 2, but here it is for the current round where
            the voting finished.
            [/LIST]


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_votemap[/B][/COLOR]', to receive a list of maps and will to perform a map voting
     as if it was an automatic end of map voting. It has the following optional arguments:


            [LIST]
            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-nointro[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the countdown "7", "6", "5", "4", "3", "2", "1"
            will be skipped and the voting will start immediately as you send the command.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-norunoff[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the runoff vote will be disabled
            for this voting, if it is not already disabled by the cvar `gal_runoff_enabled`.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-noextension[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map extension will be disabled
            for this voting, if it is not already disabled by the cvar `amx_extendmap_step`.


            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-loadnominations[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map nominations will be loaded
            for this voting, if they are enabled by the cvar `gal_nom_playerallowance`.
            [/LIST]

    [B]Usage examples:[/B]
    [code]
These are the `gal_votemap` command usage examples:

gal_votemap map1 map2 map3 map4 ... map9
gal_votemap map1 map2 map3 map4 ... map9 -nointro -noextension -norunoff
gal_votemap map1 map2 map3 map4 ... map9 -nointro -noextension
gal_votemap map1 map2 map3
gal_votemap map1 map2 -nointro -noextension
gal_votemap map1 map2 -nointro
gal_votemap map1 map2 -loadnominations
gal_votemap map1 map2
    [/code]


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_createmapfile filename[/B][/COLOR]', creates a file that contains a list of every
     valid map in your maps folder. The [B]filename[/B] argument indicates specifies the name
     to be used for the new file.  It will be created in the [COLOR="Blue"][B]./configs/galileo/[/B][/COLOR] folder.


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]quit2[/B][/COLOR]' to be used instead of `quit`, when you want to the server
     to restart on the same map it was before. It requires the cvar `[B]gal_srv_start[/B]` to be set to 1.


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_changelevel[/B][/COLOR]', to immediately change level to the current map at
     the [COLOR="Blue"][B]cvar nextmap[/B][/COLOR]. If the next map is set to `[not yet voted on]` the map will
     be changed the next map on the map cycle. If the argument `now` is provided as in `[b]gal_changelevel[/b] now`, the
     5 seconds countdown just before change level will not be presented.


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_look_for_crashes[/B][/COLOR]', to search crashing maps through all your server maps. This command will:

     [LIST=1]
     [*]Set the mp_chattime to 3,
     [*]Change the map to the next map every 7 seconds,
     [/LIST]

     Currently I did not implement to Galileo stop automatically when it look through all you server
     maps. If you want to stop it, run the same command `[B]gal_look_for_crashes[/B]` on your server
     console. After stop, it will output the contents of the crashing maps at:
     [code]
addons/amxmodx/data/galileo/maps_where_the_server_probably_crashed.txt
     [/code]

 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]say galmenu [page_number][/B][/COLOR]', (admin MAP level required) to choose from the loaded server
     maps, the maps to create a map voting by a menu, as the one with the `gal_votemap` command. Consider here the
     nomination file list as maps source to build up the menu. If specified the `page_number` argument, the menu
     will be opened a the specified page. Example: `[b]say galmenu 50[/b]` will open the menu right on the page 50.
     If the argument `page_number` is omitted, the menu will open at the first page, or the last page
     you opened it. It requires the cvar `[b]gal_nom_playerallowance[/b]` to be set to a value higher than 0.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Maintenance Mode[/B][/COLOR]:
     If the owner of the server is fixing something or updating the server and doesn't wanna the map
     to be changed, he will enable the maintenance command '[B]gal_maintenance_mode[/B]', so the map
     can't be changed by any method like gal_startvote/rtv/timeleft or maxrounds ended... and will displayed
     a print chat with something like that: You cannot change the map when the server is in mode maintenance.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]New Recent Maps List[/B][/COLOR]:
     Maps are commonly repeated on the vote and there is no chance for all of them. Hence on server
     to get to play on, you need the use the '[B]gal_banrecent[/B]' to ban these 1000+ maps. Because of this,
     players can't nominate maps for few days. [COLOR="Red"]The proposition[/COLOR] is adding a file to the plugin, in which
     will save map history and a bunch of recent maps won't be able to get automatically displayed on
     the voting menu, but still be able to get nominated.

     This is automatically done, it will not allow to repeat maps on the voting list until all them to be
     showed at least once. The cvar '[B]gal_recent_nom_maps[/B]' control whether this feature is activated
     or not. See it on the 'galileo.cfg' file.

     When the banned maps list is bigger than all maps on the server, what happens?
     It stops counting/using the recent banned list maps and randonly to start adding banned maps.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Half-File cvar 'mp_fraglimit' Support[/B][/COLOR]:
     Enable virtual support for the [COLOR="Blue"]Half-File[/COLOR] cvar '[B]mp_fraglimit[/B]' on game modes as '[COLOR="Red"]Counter-Strike[/COLOR]' which
     do not support the cvar 'mp_fraglimit'. You need to configure the 'mp_fraglimit' as you configure the
     'mp_timelimit' cvar on you 'server.cfg' file. See the cvar '[B]gal_mp_fraglimit_support[/B]' on the
     'galileo.cfg' configuration file.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Map Groups Feature[/B][/COLOR]:
     It uses whatever file you have set in the cvar '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]'. Normally, in that
     file you would just have a listing of maps, one per line. But to use the groups feature,
     your '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]' cvar would point to a '.txt' file looking something like this
     instead:
[SPOILER]
     [CODE]
[groups]
2
1
1
3
     [/CODE]The text "[B][groups][/B]" has to be the very first line in the file, on a line by itself. The
     numbers, on separate lines, specifies how many maps from each file to add to the
     voting menu.

     If you had a file within what was posted above, then you would have to create the
     files: '[B]1.ini[/B]', '[B]2.ini[/B]', '[B]3.ini[/B]', and '[B]4.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]' folder. Each of
     those INI files would contain a list of maps, one per line.

     Galileo will first load any nominated maps into the vote. Then Galileo would pick 2
     maps from '[B]1.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]2.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]3.ini[/B]', and 3 from '[B]4.ini[/B]' 'til the maximum
     value of 8 to be reached.

     [B]Another example[/B]:
     If you want to always show the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' on the map voting, just use:
     [CODE]
[groups]
1
7
     [/CODE]This maps groups configuration means to load [COLOR="red"]up to 1 map[/COLOR] from the file '[B]1.ini[/B]'
     (1st line after [B][groups][/B]) and [COLOR="red"]up to 7 maps[/COLOR] from '[B]2.ini[/B]' (2nd line after [B][groups][/B]).

     Then you only need to create the files '[B]1.ini[/B]' and '[B]2.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]'
     folder. And in the file '[B]1.ini[/B]' you put only the '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' map, and in the file '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     you put your mapcycle or voting filler maps file list.

     Hence the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will always be available on any voting. It only will not be
     displayed, if and only if, the nominations are enabled and there are [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7[/B][/COLOR] map
     nominations and none of them is '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]'. The map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be loaded
     on this case because the maximum maps available on any voting is [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7 = 8[/B][/COLOR].
     And as the map nominations are loaded before filling the map voting list using the
     map fillers from your map groups files '[B]1.ini[/B]' (1st line after [B][groups][/B]) and '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     (2nd line after [B][groups][/B]), the map '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be added because there is not
     enough space.
[/SPOILER]


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Whitelist Feature[/B][/COLOR]:
     If uses whatever file you set on the cvar '[B]gal_vote_whitelist_mapfile[/B]' as the
     Whitelist. It specifies the time where its listed maps are allowed to be added to
     the voting list as fillers after the [B]nominations[/B] being loaded.
[SPOILER]
     The Whitelist must follow this pattern:
     [CODE]
[10-22]
de_dust2
de_inferno

[23-05]
de_tuscan_mgc
de_mirage

[05-10]
de_dust2_long
     [/CODE] The maps following '[B][10-22][/B]' will be only allowed to be vote map fillers between
     10:00:00 and 22:59:59 o'clock. This feature should be helpful because some servers have
     about only 10 players between 05:00 and 10:00 o'clock, so they will be needing [COLOR="Blue"]small
     maps[/COLOR] for playing. Basically, the Whitelist is a filter to your mapcycle/filler list.

     It is an whitelist:
     [URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist"] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist[/URL]

     It is a list to specifies the time where the maps are [B][COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR][/B].
     It is not a list to specifies the time where the maps are [B][COLOR="red"]blocked[/COLOR][/B] (directly).

     So, instead of to think on which time you want to [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] them.
     To think on which time you want to [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] them.

     Using [10-22], means:

     1) You want to [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] them between 10:00:00 hours (morning) until 22:59:59 (night).
     2) Doing it, will cause to [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] them between 22:00:00 (today night), until 09:59:59 (tomorrow morning).
     3) If the cvar 'gal_whitelist_block_out' = 1, it will always [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] all maps not following any rules as [10-21], [3-11], etc.
     4) If the cvar 'gal_whitelist_block_out' = 0, it will always [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] all maps not following any rules as [10-21], [3-11], etc.

     Hence,
     [LIST=1]
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]09[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Red"]blocked[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]10[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]21[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]22[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]23[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Red"]blocked[/COLOR].
     [*]and so on...
     [/LIST]

     To block them between 10-22, change your config file to:
     [code]
[22-10]
de_dust2
de_inferno
     [/code]
     Now [10-10] stands for from 10:00:00 until 10:59:59.
     Now [10-11] stands for from 10:00:00 until 11:59:59.
     Now [5-3] stands for from 5:00:00 (yesterday/today) until 3:59:59 (today/tomorrow).
     Now [1-23] stands for from 1:00:00 until 23:59:59.
     Now [1-22] stands for from 1:00:00 until 22:59:59.
     Now [0-23] stands for from 0:00:00 until 23:59:59.
     And so on...

A lot of time and effort went into making this plugin, making features just right,
making sure there were no bugs, making sure it was easy to use. If you are glad I made

  [*]When submitting a [color="blue"][b]feature[/b][/color] or [b]enhancement[/b] request:
  1. Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
  2. Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.


  [*]If you are [B]posting[/B] because the plugin or a [B]feature[/B] of the plugin isn't working for you, [B]please[/B] do
  all of the following, so we can [COLOR="Blue"]more efficiently[/COLOR] figure out what's going on::

  [b]Summary[/b]
  ...

  [b]Expected behavior[/b]
  ...

  [b]Actual behavior[/b]
  ...

  [b]Steps to reproduce[/b]
  1. First step
  2. Second step
  3. Third step

  [b]Environment[/b]


  [LIST=1]
    [*]If you have access to your [COLOR="Blue"][B]game [color="green"]server[/color]'s console[/B][/COLOR], type the [COLOR="Red"][B]following[/B][/COLOR] commands in the [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] console:
    [LIST]
      [*]status
      [*]version
      [*]meta list
      [*]amxx list
      [*]amxx cvars
    [/LIST]

    If you don't have access the your game [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color]'s console, join your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] and type the [COLOR="Red"][B]following[/B][/COLOR]
    commands in your [COLOR="Blue"][B]game's console[/B][/COLOR]:
    [LIST]
      [*]status
      [*]rcon_password "YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD"
      [*]rcon version
      [*]rcon meta list
      [*]rcon amxx list
      [*]rcon amxx cvars
    [/LIST]


    [LIST=1]
      [*]Paste here everything from the [B]status[/B] command [COLOR="Red"][B]*except*[/B][/COLOR] the player list.
      [*]Paste here the entire result from the [B]version[/B], [B]meta list[/B] and [B]amxx list[/B] commands.
      [*]Paste here [COLOR="red"][B]*only*[/B][/COLOR] the CVARs that contain "[COLOR="green"][B]galileo.amxx[/B][/COLOR]" in the last column
      from the [B]amxx cvars[/B] command. They will be grouped together.
    [/LIST]


    [*]To enable the [b]Galileo[/b] logging, editing the `galileo.sma` changing the `DEBUG_LEVEL` variable.
    You need to set the DEBUG_LEVEL to 16, instead of the level 0 as default. [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2526315&postcount=752#Development"]See here where[/URL] to do it.

    After that, to compile, install the plugin, restart your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] and let your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] run until the problem
    you are experiencing happens and after that send me by PM or post on the forum the log file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo_log.txt[/COLOR]'.
    The log file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo_log.txt[/COLOR]' will be at the folder '[COLOR="blue"]addons/amxmodx/logs[/COLOR]'.

    The file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo_log.txt[/COLOR]' will be very helpful to find out why it is not working.
    You current plugin is not creating the file log file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo_log.txt[/COLOR]', only the one with the debugging
    log enabled, as I explained above with the DEBUG_LEVEL 16 constant inside the plugin.


    [*]If you are having problems with the [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] cvars changing when they should not, you can also enable
    the [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] cvars logging. To do that, enter on your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] console and run the commands:
    [code]
condebug
log on
    [/code]
    You should see something like this output bellow, on your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] console after entering these commands just above:
    [code]
condebug
condebug enabled
log on
Server logging data to file logs\L0618002.log
L 06/18/2017 - 12:00:30: Log file started (file "logs\L0618002.log") (game "czero") (version "48/1.0.0.3/6153")
    [/code]
    Later let you [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] run, and when the bug happens, send me by PM or post on the forum the log file `[b]qconsole.log[/b]`,
    which will be on the `Half-File` folder or on your Game Mod's folder as `cstrike` or `czero`.


    [*]If your [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] is crashing on the start, you can look if there are any logs on the folders
    `./addons/amxmodx/logs` and `./logs`. And also enable the `[color="blue"]-condebug[/color]` option on [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] start.

    When enabled the `[color="blue"]-condebug[/color]`, the `[b]qconsole.log[/b]` file will be created on the `Half-File or your Game Mod's folder.
    If the file `[b]qconsole.log[/b]` currently does not exist, you need to enable the condebug adding `[color="blue"]-condebug[/color]` option
    to the [color="green"][b]server[/b][/color] command line options.

    Example:
    [CODE]
echo "For windows:"
start hlds.exe -console -game czero -pingboost 2 +log on -autoupdate -update [COLOR="Red"]-condebug[/COLOR] -noaff [COLOR="red"]-debug -allowdebug[/COLOR] -secure +map de_dust2 +maxplayers 32 +port 27013

echo "For Linux:"
./hlds_run -console -game cstrike -pingboost 2 +log on -autoupdate [COLOR="red"]-condebug[/COLOR] -noaff [COLOR="red"]-debug -allowdebug[/COLOR] -secure +map de_dust2 +maxplayers 32 +port 27015
    [/CODE]
